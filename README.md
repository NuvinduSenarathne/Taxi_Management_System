### Overview :
Easytaxi management system is a software application designed to efficiently manage various aspects of a taxi service or fleet. It aims to streamline operations, enhance customer service, and optimize resource allocation. The system provides secure login and access control mechanisms for different user roles, such as administrators, drivers, and passengers. Passengers can use the system to request a ride, specify the pickup and drop-off locations, and choose from various vehicle options. The system provides features like estimated fare calculation, and the ability to schedule future rides. Drivers can register, log in, and update their profiles. The system assigns rides to available drivers based on factors like proximity, ride preferences, and driver ratings. Drivers receive notifications about new ride requests and navigation assistance to reach the passenger's location. The system maintains a database of vehicles in the fleet, including details like vehicle type, registration, and maintenance history. It helps ensure that vehicles are properly assigned, inspected, and maintained. This taxi management system serves as a centralized platform to efficiently manage taxi operations, enhance the passenger experience, and ensure smooth coordination between passengers, drivers, and administrators.
